"""OpenCode agent without MCP tools — uses gcx CLI instead.

Harbor passes MCP server configs from task.toml to every agent, including
built-in ones like opencode. Without this subclass, opencode would have both
MCP tools (from mcp-grafana) and gcx CLI access, which defeats the purpose of
benchmarking gcx-only interaction. Clearing mcp_servers ensures the agent can
only reach Grafana through gcx.
